# IidabashiStationSim_FSE394
A simulation for my Japan study abroad class 2023. For this project I chose to model the pedestrian traffic for the JR line in the Iidabashi station in Tokyo to determine the effects of pedestrian movement and train frequency on foot traffic inside the station. The project was made in May 2023 with C# in Unity.
